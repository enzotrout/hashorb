# Hashphere

**Project:** Bitcoin CPU Miner and Learning Platform

**Status:** Active Development

**Repository Version:** Pre-Alpha

---

# Vision

Hashphere is an educational Bitcoin mining project whose goals are:

- Teach how Bitcoin mining actually works.
- Produce a real Bitcoin miner with no stubbed components.
- Run on macOS, Windows, Linux, and Docker with nearly identical code.
- Eventually support GPUs and additional hardware accelerators.
- Provide an attractive real-time dashboard.
- Remain understandable and well documented for developers learning the Bitcoin protocol.

# Design Principles

- Simplicity first
- Correctness before optimization
- Cross-platform by design
- Real mining only
- Minimal platform-specific code
- Reproducible development environment
- Documentation is treated as first-class code

# Current Phase

**Phase 2 — CPU Miner and Stratum Integration**

Progress:

- ✅ Runtime configuration and synchronous Stratum transport
- ✅ Subscribe, authorize, notification parsing, and authenticated share submission
- ✅ Immutable mining jobs and deterministic coinbase, Merkle, and header construction
- ✅ Double-SHA256, target calculation, and proof-of-work comparison
- ✅ Prepared mining work and bounded sequential nonce search
- ✅ Opt-in bounded live Stratum mining with at most one submission
- 🚧 Timeout-aware Stratum notification polling
- ⬜ Chunked mining orchestration and notification handling between chunks
- ⬜ Continuous CPU mining and worker scheduling
- ⬜ Multiprocess CPU backend

# Current Milestone

**Timeout-Aware Stratum Notification Polling**

Objective:

Allow an authorized synchronous Stratum client to check for supported mining
notifications for a caller-bounded duration while preserving queued messages,
newline framing, connection errors, and the transport's configured timeout.

This milestone creates the receive boundary needed before mining can be split
into bounded nonce chunks. It does not introduce chunk scheduling, job
replacement, `clean_jobs` cancellation, retries, reconnects, or continuous
mining.

---

# Next Session

Continue with:

**Complete and review timeout-aware notification polling, then design bounded
nonce-chunk orchestration.**
